Hello! If you reading this, then I've dropped mod development.
Please, refer to Q&A to understand what's going on:

Q: "So, why do you dropped this files?"
A: "I do hope that someone will take my mod to finish it." 

Q: "Is this models were used somewhere before?"
A: "No, they were made by me."

Q: "What's were the plans for this mod?"
A: "Honestly, not that much. 3 factions (G&K, SF, Mercs), Sangvis Ferri copies (except Ringleaders, reaper, vespids, 
jaegers, guards, dragoons, strikers, brutes and SWAPs) for each side (SF's ones are the strongest), 
a few Griffin and Kryuger's dolls and... you know GFl 2 variations for mercenaries. Players may choose a faction.
There should be some guns + control mechanic which I wanted to make by code (Aka RTS mod e.g. Reign of Nether or MineFortress)

And that's it"

Please, consider to put me in credits somewhere, if you gonna rewrite mod.

Short summary:

Mod made by using MCreator.
When player spawns for the first time, they should pick a side.

G&K:
- Pistol (random)
- 46 Ammo
- 10 Rations
- 12 Manpower
- 8 Parts
- 1-3 Tactical Dolls (random)
- Command Tablet (Guide and other stuff)

Mercs:
- Pistol (random
- SMG (random)
- 46 Ammo
- 10 Rations
- 2-3 Grenades
- Black Market Ticket (Portable Shop)

SF:
- Ripper's SMG
- 32 Ammo
- 6 Rations
- 16 Parts
- 2-4 Dinergates
- 1-2 Ripper
- Operator's Tablet (Short control panel, let's you use your's SFs as RTS units on short range)

There should be blocks for building portable bases, which you should craft manually. There are factions' specific craft
recipees. Invalid team craft should return resources. Also there are "reprogramming". If you've picked enemy's faction SF robot - it must turn onto your side.

Have fun!
